## EDUCATION
**University of Science and Technology of China**
+ BS in Applied Physics (Condensed Matter)  

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**University of Science and Technology of China** (Hehei, China)
`Research Assistant to Professor Zhenyu Zhan` (July 2020 – Present)
**Topic**: The Interface Physics and Electronic Properties in TMD Hybrid Heterostructures
+ To study further on the hybrid TMD heterostructure system, focus on the interface properties, and try to figure out the influence of the hybrid interface on the band alignment and electronic properties across the interface
+ Calculate the local band structure along the direction perpendicular to the lateral interface, and compare to the single layer lateral heterostructure
+ Calculate the position of the atoms along the direction perpendicular to the lateral interface (x direction)
+ Apply Python to program the calculation code and plot the plane averaged charge density difference figure as
well as the 2D charge density difference contour map
+ Calculate and plot the band offset in this hybrid heterostructure system

**University of Science and Technology of China** (Hefei, China)
`Research Assistant to Professor Zhenyu Zhang` (Feb 2020 – June 2020)
**Topic**: Structural Symmetry and Compensate Effect in Transition-metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) Hybrid Heterostructures
+ To figure out the structural symmetry and electronic properties of the newly proposed hybrid TMD heterostructure with both vertical van der Waals stacks and lateral covalent bond connections
+ Proposed the idea of hybrid TMD heterostructure, and established the lattice model of it via Materials Studio
+ Calculated the density of sate and band structure through VASP
+ Compared the van der Waals heterostructure with lateral heterostructure to find the symmetry and the hidden
electronic compensate effect in this system
+ Obtained A for the graduation thesis

**Nanyang Technological University** (Singapore)
`Research Assistant to Professor Yang Zhao` (July 2019 – Sept 2019)
**Topic**: Research on Photon and Phonon Dynamics in One-Qubit Dissipative System
+ To study the photon and phonon dynamics in the one-qubit system coupled to a photon bath and a phonon bath simultaneously by Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle combined with the multiple Davydov D2 ansatz
+ Studied the Rabi model and conducted literature review in this field
+ Used Matlab to simulate the dynamic behaviors of this system on the basis of Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent
variational principle and the multiple Davydov D2 ansatz with the help of senior students
+ Elucidated the interesting dynamical behaviors in this rudimentary system

**University of Science and Technology of China** (Hefei, China)
`Research Assistant to Professor Zhongping Wang` (Sept 2018 – Nov 2018)
**Topic**: Research on Transparent Screen
